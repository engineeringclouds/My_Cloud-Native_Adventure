### Key Terms 

Key terms to know as you start your Linux learning journey. Keep an eye on the markdown file mentioned above as I will be keeping it updated as I progress with the refresher.

* **Open Source Software (OSS):** Open Source is a software development model where you create and develop your software _in the open_. This encourages open collaboration and free access to software. This means that anyone can review and contribute to the software, which can foster greater public trust than closed-source or proprietary software.
* **Distribution:** A distribution is a collection of software and applications that make up an Operating System based on the Linux Kernel. Distributions can be separated into _'families'_ based on the upstream parent that the OS is based on. An example of a distribution family would be Debian with Ubuntu and PopOS being members of the Debian family.
* **Kernel:** A Kernel is the foundation layer of your operating system which handles the interactions between the computer hardware and the software running within the operating system. All Linux distributions are based on the Linux Kernel which was first created in 1991, by Linux Torvalds. _(ref: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel))_
* **Boot Loader:** A boot loader is a program that starts first and loads the kernel into memory. The kernel then starts the rest of the operating system. GRUB is the most common boot loader for Linux distributions. See ref. for more details. _(ref: [itsfoss.com](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-grub/))_
* **FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard):** The FHS defines the directory structure for Linux OS'. The FHS is maintained by **The Linux Foundation**. See the image below and the reference for more information on the FHS. _(ref: [linuxconfig.org/filesystem-basics](https://linuxconfig.org/filesystem-basics))_

* **Working directory:** Your working directory is the directory in which you are performing tasks.
* **Absolute path:** An absolute path is a file or directory path that always starts in the root directory. For example, the absolute path to my home directory is '/home/kcooke'. An absolute path always starts with '/'.
* **Relative path:** A relative path always starts in your current working directory and never starts with '/'.
* **Shell:** A shell is the command line interface in a Linux system. 
* **Bash:** Bash or Bourne-Again Shell is a shell language that operates on Linux, macOS, and BSD systems. You can use bash to issues single commands or to author powerful scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
